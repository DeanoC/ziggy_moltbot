# UI basics

ZiggyStarClaw provides a small, focused UI for chat and operator workflows.

## Main areas
- **Chat**: send and view messages
- **Operator**: node status and actions
- **Settings**: connection and update info

## Settings panel
- **Server URL** and **Token** live here
- **Insecure TLS** disables certificate checks (use with care)
- **Updates** shows current version and release links

## Operator panel
- Shows connected nodes
- Includes quick actions where supported by the server

If you don’t see a panel, check the menu bar or reset layout (if available).
