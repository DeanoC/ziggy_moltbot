# Updates

ZiggyStarClaw checks for updates using the latest release metadata.

## What it uses
- Release page: shows the newest version
- Update manifest: `update.json` (generated during release packaging)

## How to update
1) Open the latest release page.
2) Download the bundle for your platform.
3) Replace your existing install.

If the app says “invalid download URL”, check that the update URL in Settings points to a valid release asset.
